    <h1>ðŸŽ‰ Happy Birthday, Aditya! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    
    <div class="letter">
        <h2>18!!!!</h2>
        
        <p>Dear Aditya,</p>

        <p>Happiest happiest birthday adityaaaa, yet again I successfully am not there with you on ur buddayy. Okay idk where to start what to write this is just an experiment I am doing coz u love coding and I wanna try doing something that's related to something u love. P.s I have my egd finals tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Wait firstlyyy, I love you too muchhh and I am glad u r 18 coz I am no more a pedi but I really loved making minor jokes. These 2 and a half years of ups and downs and shit loads of shit that just tried to get us apart every time but really made it, is that not enough to say that we NEEED to be together.</p>

        <p>You make me so happy aditya, ik this sounds very cliche but I really fucking love being around u (even tho we spend most of the time fighting), I am just happier and goofier and more like myself around u, I am also funnier around u no wait I am actually funny in general and u r so lame we make the best combo of opposites attract bro like there's not even one fucking thing in common , not even the most basic shit that's crazy and we still manage to deal with each other.</p>

        <p>Thanks to all our fights for getting us closer and closer every time, it's literally the only time u open u mouth and say something and at least that way I get to know somethings (hope u aren't still in love w treya) but ye idc if u r mentally fucked I accept u for who u r, u think its an imperfection I think its parts of u that make u urself, it means that I won't try to change u into someone different, it means that I will always care for u and be there for u no matter what comes between us, it means that I'll stand by u and love you through the worst of time ( I promise). I care enough to fight for you and never let go.</p>

        <p>I love you soooomuch aditya like u don't even know how much when I say sm coz I am not very expressive about it but I just really am obsessed with u like I still have the hugest crush on u even tho u r my bf. put me in a room of not 5, 100 other guys who might look better than u and I'd fucking choose u mahn I don't even care how they look who they areee the only person I'd want to see and be with in that room or anywhere is only you and I really mean this like really really really.</p>

        <p>And lastly, I miss you so much udk like sm I am literally in tears while even typing this, there's no day that pasts by without me wanting u to be there with me, at the end of the day may it be a good one or a bad one I just really wish I could see u and just tell u everything I did, I just love being with u mahn I just feel so much better and this happiness is just there when I am with u. For this exact reason I want to us to talk over call everyday coz we can't meet.</p>

        <p>You are my favourite person aditya, I really hope this never ends coz I literally can't ever live w it, the thought itself gets me in the head bro its crazy, please don't ever unloved me, please don't ever love someone else like u love me, please don't ever replace me, pleaseee just stick by and never let go.</p>

        <p>That was supposed to be the lastly but I just remembered something, there is a part in this song in Telugu that goes "stay with me in my life till my last breath as anything" my conversion skills r bad but it basically means u just need to be there as a part as anything any role in my life till my last breath, and I keep listening to that part on repeat so often coz that's literally how I need u in my life.</p>

        <p>Okay I am done I think HAPPY BIRTHDAY once agaiiiinn</p>

        <p> don't have too much fun without me ðŸŽˆ</p>

        <p class="signature">With lots of love, <br>[princess]</p>
